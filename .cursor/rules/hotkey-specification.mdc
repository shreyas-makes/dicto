# Dicto Hotkey Specification

## Primary Hotkey: CTRL+V (Not CMD+V)

The Dicto application MUST use **CTRL+V** as the global hotkey combination for voice recording, not CMD+V.

### Key Implementation Files:
- [continuous_recorder.py](mdc:continuous_recorder.py) - Main hotkey detection logic
- [dicto_main.py](mdc:dicto_main.py) - Fallback hotkey manager 

### Requirements:
1. **CTRL+V Combination**: Use `Key.ctrl_l` or `Key.ctrl_r` + 'v' key
2. **Cross-Platform**: CTRL works on both macOS and other platforms
3. **Hold Behavior**: Continuous recording while CTRL+V is held down
4. **Release Behavior**: Stop recording when either key is released

### Implementation Details:
- Use `pynput.keyboard.Key.ctrl_l` and `Key.ctrl_r` for control keys
- Track both left and right CTRL keys for reliability
- Variable name: Use `ctrl_pressed` not `cmd_pressed`
- Log messages should reference "CTRL+V" not "CMD+V"

### Code Pattern:
```python
if key == Key.ctrl_l or key == Key.ctrl_r:
    self.ctrl_pressed = True
elif hasattr(key, 'char') and key.char and key.char.lower() == 'v':
    self.v_pressed = True

if self.ctrl_pressed and self.v_pressed:
    # Start recording
```

This ensures consistent CTRL+V behavior across all platforms and matches user expectations.

You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 10 of 12.

GOAL: Optimize performance for system-wide operation and add comprehensive monitoring.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-9):
1. Profile and optimize system-wide application performance
2. Implement intelligent resource management for background operation
3. Add performance monitoring and adaptive optimization
4. Optimize memory usage and battery life impact
5. Implement smart caching and preloading strategies

DELIVERABLES:
- performance_monitor.py with PerformanceMonitor class containing:
  - monitor_system_resources() for resource tracking
  - adaptive_optimization() for dynamic performance tuning
  - battery_optimization() for power-efficient operation
  - cache_manager() for intelligent data caching
  - performance_analytics() for usage pattern analysis
- Enhanced dicto_main.py with performance optimizations
- benchmark_suite.py for comprehensive performance testing
- test_performance.py for performance validation

OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
- Minimize CPU usage during idle/background operation
- Reduce memory footprint for always-running application
- Optimize hotkey response time and audio processing latency
- Implement efficient model loading and caching
- Minimize battery impact on laptops

PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
- Track system resource usage patterns
- Monitor hotkey response latency
- Analyze transcription processing efficiency
- Log memory usage and cleanup effectiveness

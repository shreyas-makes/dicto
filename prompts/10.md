You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 10 of 12.

GOAL: Optimize performance and add monitoring for better user experience.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-9):
1. Profile application performance to identify bottlenecks
2. Implement performance optimizations for audio processing
3. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
4. Optimize memory usage and resource management
5. Implement smart caching where appropriate

DELIVERABLES:
- performance_monitor.py with PerformanceMonitor class containing:
  - start_timer(operation_name) and end_timer(operation_name) methods
  - get_memory_usage() monitoring
  - log_performance_metrics() for analysis
  - get_performance_report() summary method
- Optimized audio processing pipeline
- Enhanced resource management in all modules
- test_performance.py for performance benchmarking

OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
- Reduce transcription processing time
- Minimize memory usage during recording
- Optimize temporary file handling
- Reduce startup time
- Improve hotkey response time
- Optimize audio format conversion

PERFORMANCE MONITORING:
- Track recording duration vs. processing time
- Monitor memory usage throughout workflow
- Log file I/O performance
- Track hotkey response latency
- Monitor system resource usage

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use time.perf_counter() for precise timing
- Implement context managers for automatic timing
- Add memory profiling with psutil (optional dependency)
- Cache frequently accessed data (model loading, etc.)
- Optimize subprocess calls and file operations

TESTING:
- Should show measurable performance improvements
- Should track key performance metrics
- Should handle performance monitoring gracefully
- Should provide useful performance reports
- Should be runnable as: python test_performance.py

End result: Fast, efficient app with performance insights.

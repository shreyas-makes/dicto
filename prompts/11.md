You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 11 of 12.

GOAL: Create automated setup and installation system for easy deployment.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-10):
1. Create comprehensive setup script for new users
2. Automate dependency detection and installation
3. Handle system permissions and requirements
4. Create user-friendly installation process
5. Add verification and troubleshooting tools

DELIVERABLES:
- setup.py main setup script with:
  - check_system_compatibility() for macOS version
  - install_dependencies() for all required packages
  - setup_whisper_cpp() automated compilation
  - download_models() for whisper models
  - setup_permissions() guidance for accessibility/microphone
  - verify_installation() comprehensive testing
- install.sh shell script for one-command setup

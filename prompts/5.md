You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 5 of 12.

GOAL: Implement global hotkey system using Cmd+V for record/stop toggle.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-4):
1. Install pynput library for global hotkey detection
2. Create HotkeyManager class for Cmd+V handling
3. Implement toggle-based recording (press once to start, press again to stop)
4. Handle macOS accessibility permissions gracefully
5. Integrate hotkeys with existing recording/transcription pipeline

DELIVERABLES:
- hotkey_manager.py with HotkeyManager class containing:
  - check_accessibility_permissions() method
  - setup_hotkeys() for Cmd+V detection
  - toggle_recording() method that starts/stops recording
  - Integration with AudioRecorder and TranscriptionEngine
  - Proper cleanup and exit handling
- Updated requirements.txt to include pynput
- dicto_hotkey.py main application with hotkey support
- test_hotkeys.py for testing (with fallback for permission issues)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use pynput.keyboard for global hotkey detection
- Implement state management (idle, recording, processing)
- Handle Cmd+V collision with system clipboard (if any)
- Provide clear feedback about app state
- Handle permission errors gracefully with helpful messages

TESTING:
- Should detect Cmd+V presses system-wide
- Should toggle recording state correctly
- Should provide clear error messages for permission issues
- Should work alongside existing CLI version
- Should be runnable as: python dicto_hotkey.py

PERMISSION HANDLING:
- Check accessibility permissions on startup
- Provide clear instructions for granting permissions
- Graceful fallback if permissions not available

End result: Hands-free recording via global hotkeys.

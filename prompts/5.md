You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 5 of 12.

GOAL: Enhance audio processing capabilities and add support for multiple input sources and formats.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-4):
1. Add support for multiple audio input devices (microphones, line-in, etc.)
2. Implement real-time audio level monitoring and voice activity detection
3. Add noise reduction and audio enhancement capabilities
4. Support for importing and transcribing existing audio files
5. Add recording quality options and format optimization

DELIVERABLES:
- audio_processor.py with AudioProcessor class containing:
  - list_audio_devices() for device enumeration
  - set_input_device(device_id) for device selection
  - get_audio_level() for real-time level monitoring
  - apply_noise_reduction() for audio enhancement
  - voice_activity_detection() to auto-start/stop recording
- file_processor.py for handling various audio file formats
- Enhanced dicto_main.py with audio device selection and processing options
- test_audio_processing.py for testing audio enhancements

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use SoX effects for noise reduction and normalization
- Implement voice activity detection to reduce silence
- Support common audio formats (MP3, M4A, FLAC, etc.)
- Add automatic gain control and audio level normalization
- Provide audio device selection interface

TESTING:
- Should list available audio input devices
- Should handle different microphone types and qualities
- Should process existing audio files correctly
- Should provide real-time audio feedback
- Should be runnable as: python test_audio_processing.py

End result: Professional-grade audio processing with multiple input options.

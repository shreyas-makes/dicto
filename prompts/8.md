You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 8 of 12.

GOAL: Add comprehensive error handling, logging, and automatic recovery throughout the system-wide application.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-7):
1. Implement comprehensive logging system with user-friendly error reporting
2. Add automatic error recovery mechanisms for common failures
3. Create robust permission management and guidance system
4. Add application state persistence and crash recovery
5. Implement comprehensive diagnostic and troubleshooting tools

DELIVERABLES:
- error_handler.py with ErrorHandler class containing:
  - setup_logging() with file and console output
  - handle_system_errors() for macOS-specific issues
  - recover_from_crash() for application state restoration
  - generate_diagnostic_report() for troubleshooting
  - check_system_health() for proactive issue detection
- Updated dicto_main.py with comprehensive error handling
- diagnostic_tool.py for system health checks and troubleshooting
- test_error_scenarios.py for testing failure conditions

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use Python logging with rotating file handlers
- Implement automatic restart mechanisms for recoverable errors
- Add comprehensive permission checking and guidance
- Store application state for crash recovery
- Create detailed diagnostic reports for support

ERROR SCENARIOS TO HANDLE:
- System-wide permission changes during operation
- Audio device disconnection/reconnection
- Model file corruption or unavailability
- Memory pressure and resource exhaustion
- Hotkey conflicts with other applications
- Network connectivity issues (for updates)

TESTING:
- Should handle all common error scenarios gracefully
- Should provide clear user guidance for permission issues
- Should recover application state after crashes
- Should generate useful diagnostic information
- Should be runnable as: python test_error_scenarios.py

End result: Bulletproof system-wide application with intelligent error handling and recovery.

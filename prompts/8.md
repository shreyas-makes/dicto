You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 8 of 12.

GOAL: Add comprehensive error handling, logging, and robustness throughout the application.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-7):
1. Implement comprehensive logging system
2. Add error recovery mechanisms for common failures
3. Handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully
4. Add proper resource cleanup and memory management
5. Create comprehensive error reporting

DELIVERABLES:
- error_handler.py with ErrorHandler class containing:
  - setup_logging() with file and console output
  - handle_audio_error() for recording issues
  - handle_transcription_error() for whisper.cpp issues
  - handle_permission_error() for system access issues
  - log_performance_metrics() for debugging
- Updated all existing modules with proper error handling
- Enhanced dicto_hotkey.py with robustness improvements
- test_error_handling.py for testing failure scenarios

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use Python logging module with proper levels
- Create log files in user's home directory
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Add timeout handling for long operations
- Proper cleanup of temporary files and processes
- Memory usage monitoring and cleanup

ERROR SCENARIOS TO HANDLE:
- Microphone access denied or unavailable
- SoX installation missing or broken
- Whisper.cpp binary missing or corrupt
- Model file missing or corrupted
- Disk space full during recording
- Network issues (should not affect offline app)
- Accessibility permissions revoked
- Application state corruption

TESTING:
- Should handle all common error scenarios gracefully
- Should provide helpful error messages to users
- Should log detailed information for debugging
- Should clean up resources properly
- Should be runnable as: python test_error_handling.py

End result: Robust application that handles failures gracefully and provides debugging information.

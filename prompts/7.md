You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 7 of 12.

GOAL: Add native macOS notifications for real-time user feedback during transcription.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-6):
1. Install plyer for cross-platform notifications
2. Create NotificationManager class for user feedback
3. Add notifications for recording states (start, stop, processing, complete)
4. Integrate notifications with existing workflow
5. Handle notification permissions gracefully

DELIVERABLES:
- notification_manager.py with NotificationManager class containing:
  - show_notification(title, message, timeout) method
  - show_recording_started() convenience method
  - show_processing() convenience method  
  - show_transcription_complete(text_preview) convenience method
  - show_error(error_message) convenience method
  - Handle notification permission issues
- Updated dicto_hotkey.py with notification integration
- Updated requirements.txt to include plyer
- test_notifications.py for testing notification system

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use plyer.notification for macOS native notifications
- Provide appropriate notification titles and messages
- Include brief text preview in completion notification
- Handle cases where notifications are disabled
- Ensure notifications don't interfere with recording

NOTIFICATION WORKFLOW:
- "Recording started..." when Cmd+V pressed (recording begins)
- "Processing transcription..." when recording stops
- "Transcription complete: [preview]" when done
- "Error: [message]" for any failures
- All notifications should be brief and informative

TESTING:
- Should show notifications at appropriate times
- Should handle notification permission issues
- Should not break workflow if notifications fail
- Should provide helpful feedback to user
- Should be runnable as: python test_notifications.py

End result: Clear user feedback through macOS notification system.

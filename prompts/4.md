You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 4 of 12.

GOAL: Create a usable CLI app with manual controls for recording and transcription.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-3):
1. Create main application entry point with CLI interface
2. Add manual keyboard controls for record/stop
3. Implement main application loop with user instructions
4. Display transcription results in terminal
5. Add basic status messages and feedback

DELIVERABLES:
- dicto_cli.py main application with:
  - Welcome message and usage instructions
  - Interactive command prompt (Press ENTER to record, ENTER again to stop)
  - Integration of AudioRecorder and TranscriptionEngine
  - Clear status messages during recording/processing
  - Display of transcription results
  - Option to quit or record again
- Enhanced error handling for the complete pipeline
- test_cli_app.py for automated testing where possible

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use input() for simple user controls
- Provide clear visual feedback (recording status, processing status)
- Handle keyboard interrupts gracefully (Ctrl+C)
- Show processing time and file information
- Clear console display for better UX

TESTING:
- Should start with clear instructions
- Should record when user presses ENTER
- Should stop recording and transcribe on second ENTER
- Should display results clearly
- Should allow multiple recording sessions
- Should be runnable as: python dicto_cli.py

End result: Fully functional CLI transcription app that users can actually use.

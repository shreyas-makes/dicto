You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 3 of 12.

GOAL: Add SoX-based audio recording capability and integrate with transcription.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-2):
1. Install and verify SoX availability on macOS
2. Create AudioRecorder class that uses SoX for recording
3. Implement start_recording() and stop_recording() methods
4. Integrate recording with existing TranscriptionEngine
5. Create complete record-and-transcribe workflow

DELIVERABLES:
- audio_recorder.py with AudioRecorder class containing:
  - check_dependencies() to verify SoX installation
  - start_recording() method (non-blocking)
  - stop_recording() method that returns audio file path
  - Auto-cleanup of temporary audio files
  - Proper error handling and logging
- Updated dicto_core.py to integrate AudioRecorder
- test_recording.py that:
  - Tests SoX installation
  - Records short audio sample
  - Transcribes the recording
  - Displays results

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use SoX for 16kHz mono WAV recording (optimal for Whisper)
- Use subprocess with proper signal handling
- Create temporary files in system temp directory
- Clean up audio files after transcription
- Handle microphone permission issues gracefully

TESTING:
- Should detect and install SoX if needed
- Should record and transcribe user speech
- Should handle start/stop recording correctly
- Should clean up temporary files
- Should be runnable as: python test_recording.py

End result: Working voice recording and transcription pipeline.

You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 1 of 12.

GOAL: Set up whisper.cpp with Metal acceleration and verify basic transcription works.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Clone the whisper.cpp repository from https://github.com/ggml-ai/whisper.cpp
2. Build whisper.cpp with Metal acceleration for Apple Silicon
3. Download the base.en model (English language, ~147MB)
4. Test transcription with a sample audio file
5. Create a simple verification script that proves everything works

DELIVERABLES:
- Working whisper.cpp binary in build/bin/whisper-cli
- Downloaded model file: models/ggml-base.en.bin
- test_whisper_setup.py script that:
  - Checks if whisper binary exists
  - Checks if model file exists  
  - Tests transcription on provided sample audio
  - Prints clear success/failure messages
  - Logs all steps to console

TESTING:
- Script should run without errors
- Should output sample transcription text
- Should verify file paths and dependencies
- Should provide clear error messages if anything fails

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must work on macOS (Apple Silicon preferred)
- Use Metal acceleration if available
- Keep all processing local/offline
- Include comprehensive console logging for debugging

Start with repository cloning and build process. Create the verification script last.

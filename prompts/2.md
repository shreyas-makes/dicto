You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 2 of 12.

GOAL: Create a Python wrapper around whisper.cpp that can transcribe audio files.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Task 1):
1. Set up Python virtual environment with requirements.txt
2. Create dicto_core.py that wraps whisper.cpp calls
3. Implement transcribe_file() function that:
   - Takes audio file path as input
   - Calls whisper.cpp binary with proper arguments
   - Returns transcription text
   - Handles errors gracefully
4. Create test_transcription.py that tests the wrapper

DELIVERABLES:
- requirements.txt with initial dependencies
- dicto_core.py with TranscriptionEngine class containing:
  - __init__ method that verifies whisper binary and model
  - transcribe_file(audio_path) method
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Console output for debugging
- test_transcription.py that:
  - Tests transcription with sample audio file
  - Verifies error handling with invalid files
  - Prints results clearly

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use subprocess to call whisper.cpp binary
- Handle common errors (missing files, permission issues)
- Log all subprocess calls and outputs
- Return structured results (success/failure + text)

TESTING:
- Should transcribe provided sample audio correctly
- Should handle missing files gracefully
- Should provide clear error messages
- Should be runnable as: python test_transcription.py

The core functionality should be ready for integration into a larger app.

You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 6 of 12.

GOAL: Add multi-language support and advanced transcription features for diverse use cases.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-5):
1. Add automatic language detection for recordings
2. Support for multiple Whisper models (different sizes and languages)
3. Implement custom vocabulary and proper noun handling
4. Add transcription confidence scoring and quality metrics
5. Support for speaker identification and timestamping

DELIVERABLES:
- language_manager.py with LanguageManager class containing:
  - detect_language(audio_path) for automatic detection
  - get_available_models() for model enumeration
  - load_model(model_name) for dynamic model switching
  - add_custom_vocabulary(words) for domain-specific terms
- transcription_enhancer.py for post-processing improvements
- Enhanced dicto_main.py with language selection and model options
- test_multilingual.py for testing language features

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Support multiple Whisper models (tiny, base, small, medium, large)
- Implement language auto-detection using audio characteristics
- Add custom vocabulary injection for better accuracy
- Provide confidence scores for transcription quality assessment
- Support timestamped output for longer recordings

TESTING:
- Should auto-detect common languages accurately
- Should handle domain-specific vocabulary correctly
- Should provide confidence metrics for transcriptions
- Should support model switching without restart
- Should be runnable as: python test_multilingual.py

End result: Versatile transcription engine supporting multiple languages and use cases.

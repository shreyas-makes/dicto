You are building a local AI transcription app called "Dicto" for macOS. This is Task 6 of 12.

GOAL: Add automatic clipboard integration to copy transcriptions for immediate use.

REQUIREMENTS (building on Tasks 1-5):
1. Install AppKit for native macOS clipboard access
2. Create ClipboardManager class for text operations
3. Auto-copy transcription results to clipboard
4. Handle clipboard conflicts with Cmd+V hotkey usage
5. Add user feedback for clipboard operations

DELIVERABLES:
- clipboard_manager.py with ClipboardManager class containing:
  - copy_to_clipboard(text) method using AppKit
  - get_clipboard_content() for conflict detection
  - clear_clipboard() utility method
  - Error handling for clipboard access issues
- Updated dicto_hotkey.py to include clipboard integration
- Updated requirements.txt to include pyobjc-framework-AppKit
- test_clipboard.py for testing clipboard operations

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Use AppKit.NSPasteboard for native clipboard access
- Handle potential conflicts between Cmd+V hotkey and paste operation
- Provide user feedback when text is copied
- Preserve existing clipboard content when appropriate
- Handle clipboard access permissions

WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:
- After successful transcription, automatically copy text to clipboard
- User can immediately paste transcription anywhere with Cmd+V
- Clear visual/audio feedback that text is ready to paste
- Handle edge cases (empty transcription, errors)

TESTING:
- Should copy text to clipboard successfully
- Should handle clipboard access errors gracefully
- Should work with hotkey system without conflicts
- Should preserve transcription workflow
- Should be runnable as: python test_clipboard.py

End result: Seamless voice-to-text-to-clipboard workflow.
